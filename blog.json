I plan to use this as both experimentation for front end development as well as a portfolio site to expand upon my experiences and projects. I am fully transparently utilizing AI to achieve some of these goals, but do believe in a fundamental understanding of concepts, and using AI as a tool for efficiency rather than to replace understanding. Nice to meet you and hope you like what you see!",
